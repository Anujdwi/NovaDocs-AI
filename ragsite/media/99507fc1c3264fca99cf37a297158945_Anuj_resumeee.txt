October 2023 - November 2023
Python Intern
Remote
• Designed a dynamic web-based Weather Application using the OpenWeatherMap API and implemented in Python
that serves in 50+ locations. Applied error-handling techniques for smooth functionality.
• Analyzed web scraping techniques, particularly employing the Beautiful Soup library in Python, to extract valuable
data from various websites. Navigated HTML structures, parsing content, and extracting information from 150+ sources
and a total of 25000+ fields relevant to project requirements. Developed an understanding of web scraping
methodologies, data manipulation, and automation contributing to the success of data-driven projects.

Projects
Dynamic Review Scraper API - Python, Selenium, Cohere API, Flask
Source Code
• Developed an API server for extracting product reviews from platforms by dynamically identifying review-specific CSS
elements using LLM integration (Cohere API). Implemented pagination handling to retrieve complete reviews data.
Designed a GET API endpoint returning a JSON response with total reviews and detailed data, supporting scalability
and easy integration.
Smart India Hackathon: ML-Based CAPTCHA - Python, Flask, Scikit-Learn
Source Code
• Developed a machine learning-based solution for CAPTCHA refinement aimed at differentiating between bots and
humans for enhanced security in UIDAI portals. The solution passively captures environmental and behavioral
parameters (e.g., mouse movements, typing patterns) through the browser and analyzes the data using a supervised
learning model (Random Forest). Designed a mock website with embedded data collection scripts and
trained a model to classify interactions as human or bot with high accuracy.
TourMate - Flutter, Python, MongoDB, TensorFlow, Maps API
Source Code
• Programmed a comprehensive travel planning app that assists users in creating optimized itineraries for 75 tourist
destinations. Utilized Graph Principles and Clustering Algorithms to recommend the best routes and prioritize
must-see locations within 20 kilometers of a city. Integrated Google Maps API to optimize routes and saves 25% time
of a user in travelling and planning a holiday.
